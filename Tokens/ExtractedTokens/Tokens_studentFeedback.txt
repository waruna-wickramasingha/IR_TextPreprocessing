Honestly
last
seven
lectures
are
good
.
Lectures
are
understandable
.
Lecture
slides
are
very
useful
to
self-study
also
.
The
given
opportunity
to
ask
questions
from
the
lecturer
is
appreciative
.

We
can
hear
your
voice
clearly
and
can
understand
the
things
you
teach
.
Presentation
slides
also
good
source
to
refer
.
lf
you
can
do
more
example
questions
within
the
classroom
and
it
will
help
us
to
understand
the
principles
well

Lectures
was
well
structured
and
well
organized
.
It
was
easy
to
understand
.
Lecture
slides
and
labs
were
also
well
organized
.
Lectures
were
good
.
understandable
.
The
lecture
slides
were
well
organized
and
the
examples
done
in
the
class
helped
a
lot
to
learn
this
new
language
and
also
the
principles
of
OOP
.
Motivated
to
well
.
Would
have
been
better
if
we
discussed
more
about
the
solutions
of
coding
exercisers
.
I
think
i
learned
a
lot
from
the
codes
you
write
in
the
board
.
When
i
compare
my
codes
with
yours
i
can
learn
about
my
mistakes
and
good
coding
practices
that
i
should
follow
.
There
fore
i
think
it
would
be
great
if
we
can
discuss
more
examples
in
the
class
.
madam
explained
the
oop
concepts
clearly
with
examples.lectures
were
interesting.we
want
more
scenario
examples
and
answers
with
explanations
in
future
.
I
satisfy
about
first
7
lectures
.
That
way
of
teaching
is
really
good
for
coming
lectures
too
.
lectuers
are
very
good
.
take
good
effort
to
make
undersatand
every
student
in
the
room
.
very
helpfull
.
I
was
able
to
obtain
a
clear
picture
about
OOP
and
its
concepts
.
``
lecture
slides

it

s
very
good
to
letting
ask
questions
and
explain
again
with
suitable
examples

sometimes

some

The
lectures
were
good
and
clear
.
And
they
weren
&
#

;
t
too
fast
.
Writing
code
was
somewhat
confusing
because
I
didn
&
#

;
t
know
java
before
.
Actually
teaching
is
very
good
and
can
understand
easily
the
concepts
by
examples
which
are
given
in
the
class.it
will
be
more
helpful
if
provide
solved
questions
as
well
!

thankyou
